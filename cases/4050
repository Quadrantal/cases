Caller's Arguments:

Arguments PARADOX:
Per the temperature paradox:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_paradox

A. The boulder's height was 1.
B. The boulders height was increased by 1.
C. 1 was increased by 1.

ais523 had 1 4st stamp, and 1 was increased to 2. QED.

Gratuitous Arguments by 4st:

Gratuitous arguments PARADOX:
Numbers are rule defined in R2509 "Agoran Numbers".
R1586 "Definition and Continuity of Entities" also seems to imply that
things defined by the rules are entities, which would therefore include
numbers.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge Janet's Arguments:

The caller's arguments for PARADOXICAL conflate the definition of
PARADOXICAL under Rule 991 ("appropriate if the statement is logically
undecidable as a result of a paradox or or [sic] other irresolvable
logical situation") with the broader natural language usage of the word
"paradox" (which does not require any "logical undecidab[ility]").]

The "temperature paradox" is, per the Wikipedia page the caller sites,
"a classic puzzle in formal semantics and philosophical logic". Agora is
a game played in natural language, not formal logic. Words have
meanings, and the name of a value cannot simply be replaced with the
denoted value in all contexts.

In this specific instance, there is a Rule that governs the language
being used (Rule 2509). However, even in the absence of this Rule, the
caller's suggested result would not be reached. Under Rule 217, "the
text of the rules takes precedence". This does not require or even
suggest a mechanistic reading or a reading attempting to apply rules of
formal logic. It simply requires a faithful reading.

The facts regarding ais523's stamp holdings are not otherwise in dispute.

Judged FALSE.


Judge Janet's Evidence:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2509/2 (Power=2)
Agoran Numbers

      A "number" is considered to refer to a real number, unless
      otherwise explicitly specified.  A "number of (items)", where
      (items) is a set of discrete entities, is considered to refer to a
      non-negative integer, unless otherwise explicitly specified.
      
      If a switch is defined as being associated with a specified set of
      numbers (a numerical switch), then the possible values for that
      switch are the numbers in that set. In particular, a natural or
      integer switch is a switch with possible values the non-negative
      integers or all integers, respectively. If a limit is further
      defined, the possible values are the numbers of the set within the
      specified limits.
      
      If 0 is in the specified values for a numerical switch and no
      default value is otherwise specified, 0 is the default value for
      that switch.
      
      If the rules describe mathematical operations to be used in
      flipping an instance of a numerical switch, the operations are
      interpreted as having common-sense mathematical application to
      determine that instance's resulting value. For example,
      "increasing a switch instance by M" is equivalent to "flipping a
      switch instance from its current value N to the value N+M". If the
      specified mathematical operation would result in a value outside
      that switch's defined set, the flipping CANNOT be performed, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.

Rule 217/12 (Power=3)
Interpreting the Rules

      When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
      takes precedence. Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
      unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense, past
      judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the game.
      
      Definitions and prescriptions in the rules are only to be applied
      using direct, forward reasoning; in particular, an absurdity that
      can be concluded from the assumption that a statement about
      rule-defined concepts is false does not constitute proof that it
      is true. Definitions in lower-powered Rules do not overrule
      common-sense interpretations or common definitions of terms in
      higher-powered rules, but may constructively make reasonable
      clarifications to those definitions. For this purpose, a
      clarification is reasonable if and only if it adds detail without
      changing the underlying general meaning of the term and without
      causing the higher powered rule to be read in a way inconsistent
      with its text.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any rule change that would
      (1) prevent a person from initiating a formal process to resolve
      matters of controversy, in the reasonable expectation that the
      controversy will thereby be resolved; or (2) prevent a person from
      causing formal reconsideration of any judicial determination that
      e should be punished, is wholly void and without effect.
